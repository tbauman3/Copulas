## Topic outline
Copulas are a popular framework for defining multivariate distributions and modeling multivariate data. They characterize the dependence between components of a multivariate distribution and can be combined with any set of univariate marginal distributions to form a complete joint distribution. Consequently, the use of copulas allows for leveraging a wide range of univariate models that are available.

The primary financial application of copula models lies in risk assessment and portfolio management for assets that exhibit dependence during extreme scenarios. For instance, a pair of assets may have weakly correlated returns, but their largest losses often occur during the same periods. Recently, copulas have also been frequently utilized as generators of synthetic data.

This project will outline the theory of copulas, including various types, their properties, and mathematical definitions. Alongside the theoretical framework, two examples will be provided to facilitate understanding of how copulas function in practice. Furthermore, an application of copulas in generating synthetic data will be demonstrated, highlighting its usefulness in addressing the issue of data scarcity.
